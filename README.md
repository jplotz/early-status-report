# How do I edit this s$@($

- To add/edit/remove/whatever you only need to worry about the part after
`\begin{document}` and before `\end{document}`
- just type stuff. A blank line in the text file means "new paragraph."
- If you want to add a section, put `\section{SECTION NAME}`
- If you want to add a subsection, put `\subsection{SUBSECTION NAME}`
- If you want to add a sub-subsection, put `\subsubsection{SUBSUBSECTION NAME}`
- If you want to add a sub-sub-subsection, no, please don't do that.

Please let's do nice stuff like pull requests so we don't get merge conflict or severed heads.
